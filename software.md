The Operating System is Raspbian (OS based on Debian optimized for Raspberry PI)
The user interface program sees the status of the network and calls the interconnection program when needed.

Communication takes place exclusively within a VPN (Virtual Private Network), which ensures confidentiality and access control to the
network. 

When the first connection is established, it starts a one to one communication, datas are not passing through a central server.

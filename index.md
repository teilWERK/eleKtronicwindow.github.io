# EWindow is a TECHNOLOGICAL DEVICE 
# for a NEW REVOLUTIONARY __Social Network__

It’s a public videochat system to connect different spaces based on Raspberry PI.

It looks as similar as possible to a “real” window: 
it has basic user interface and it doesn’t have mouse, keyboard, or other functions. 
It’s just a “window" in a wall.

Ewindow is:
### 1. __OPEN SOURCE__ 
// the code is here [ewindow Code](https://github.com/teilWERK) enjoy it //
### 1. __DECENTRALISED__ 
// no central control owned by some corporation using your data for other purposes //
### 1. __FREE__ 
// Everything (codes, hardware) is shared //

# STORY

The EWindow started some years ago 

After some years of trials and experiments on instant communication we decided it was time to do something bigger and we involved the Verbund Offener Werkstaetten (D) which decided to join us in the long process of making the community and spreading awarness around this theme.
Then, to maintain the software development we created a small company TEILWERK.


# WHY EWINDOW

Ewindow is a dedicated single-app device, not a desktop computer or a smartphone.

Many different EWindows, all togheter, can make their own social network. Imagine you want to connect 3 different spaces. 
Every space has its own window in a common area, like in the coffebreak, a corridor, the kitchen.
With the press of a button, the EWindow will connect to another EWindow in the same network.
Once the Window is opened, there is a # 1:1 encrypted connection.

# BUY
EWindow solves two current problems: first it let team members working in different buildings, cities or countries to share daily life and common values which is crucial team building. Second it lowers the email communication that in the last years increased so much that it loses power on communication.

# DESIGN 

THe development of the design.

*FRAME  
There is no one frame, every space build his own.

# HARDWARE DEVELOPMENT

While starting this project one of the requirement was to find low-cost technologies. 
After many trials (and errors) we went up with a simple and accessible configuration.

*ELECTRONICS LIST
- A Raspberry Pi //3 (2 is ok too)//
- 2 GiB  SD Card
- Monitor (with Cable)
- Speakers //CONNECTED VIA JACK, AND NO VIA USB//
- USB Webcam with microphones 
- A button and a bit of jumpwire

# SOFTWARE 

The EWindows are based on a software developed for running on affordable technologies (such as Raspberry Pi *raspberryPi is a open-source hardware computer. is like a small computer that you can use for prototyping.*, a flat monitor, a webcam, Linux). 
The OS is Raspbian which is a free operating system, optimized for the Raspberry Pi hardware, that coincides with the open standards as in public, transparent and accessible to everyone. It provides an encrypted and secure connection.

It is also optimized to be efficiently used on most hardware from single board computers such as the raspberry pi to high end pc’s.  And it facilitates further experimentation with new hardware of software features.

# EWINDOW NETWORKS  
The "electronic window" is a direct way to establish informal and unplanned connections. 
They can be useful for different situations.

## JOIN THE EXISTING EWINDOW NETWORK

### THE MULTIFACTORY NETWORK

The multifactory is  a network of shared workspace across Europe and the EWindow is a tool that ensures the constant circulation of ideas in sharing knowledge and in exchanging skills and professional services between the spaces involved.
A community of real people, who make a living within the collaborative economy new paradigm.

# FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

The EWindow is a technological community tool and not a personal communications tool.
The EWindow offers a third way.

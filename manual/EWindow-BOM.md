## What does it need to build a Window?

- 
- A single board computer (Raspberry Pi will do)
- The RaspiCam / any of most USB webcams
- I2S Soundcard for the Raspberry Pi
- A USB Speakerphone with built-in echo cancellation, or, a I2S Soundcard with Mic Input
- Ethernet cable with some internet (>1 MBit Upload recommended). (do yourself a favor and skip wifi :)
- A Big HDMI Display
- Frame for the Display and Camera

## Ethernet cable 
 with some internet (>1 MBit Upload recommended). (do yourself a favor and skip wifi :)

## HDMI Monitor:
you can choose between many models and brand bt take care of:
    - No standby function (has to turn on automatically on power-up)
    "Public/Info-Displays" might be better for non-stop usage
    - possibility to remove the feet
    - monitor tecnology IPS for better quality

## Frame for the Display and Camera
wood, metal or whatever you imagination can think of



## Other options under experimentation:

Audio 
It is a BIG deal,during these two years of research we also found another cheaper solution, but further testing is needed:

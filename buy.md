teilWERK is a young company that develops technological tools to enable organizations, companies and associations to adopt tools and methods of collaborative economy. It is composed of three partners: an Italian researcher, an IT developer and an expert in German additive manufacturing and has several collaborators around Europe.

The ewindow is a co-presence tool.  Co-presence is a way of working that allows distant people from the same work environment (company, organisation, project) to work together as if they were in the same room.

People from similar communities can meet during the day to drink a coffee together, as could be the case if they were in the same building.

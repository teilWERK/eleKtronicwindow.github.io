What is it?
===========

The EWindow is a video chat device that runs 24/7 in a shared space. 
The goal is a decentralized, secure 24/7 audiovisual communication system –> Like a window in a wall.

The e-window is a communication system that is open 24 hours a day on another space, as if it was the extension of the room, 
creating a seamless connection between spaces using a "projected window". 
The idea is this tool isn’t perceived as a computer but as a window and it should be integrated with the space. 
The objective is to establish connections between people who are in different cities or locations 
and to connect on a peer to peer basis people belonging to a defined group. 
The target groups we are aiming at are - Networks of maker spaces and professionals - Enterprises with multiple teams or facilities.
The e-window concept arose from the need that is that nowadays communication between companies and inside companies 
needs to be faster and as an answer to a current need for companies that have different locations  and to connect networks 
and communities of a similar attitude and scope such as cultural centers, fablabs and so on.


How does it look ?
==================
So if you imagine , it is a window through a wall where  you just go to the coffee-break area, 
and you can see other people from another space, Through an open window, people will be able to exchange ideas, 
share projects and get suggestions on what you're doing in a spontaneous way. 
In this informality of these casual encounters, companies or organizations could improve their internal communication
and their creative products.
The e-window basically looks like a real window with a flat monitor instead of glass; 
the speakers are part of the frame on sides. On top there is a webcam with microphone. 
On the bottom there are three buttons with these labels: ON/OFF- SELECT-CONNECT/UNCONNECT.


How does it work ?
==================
So when you press ON the window switches on, it automatically becomes visible to other spaces and shows a list 
of all the windows available and you can choose from the list which windows you want to connect to. 
You can also choose your status as in free or busy connection.


Software & Hardware
===================
Of course for this end, we had to develop a user-friendly interface that requires no mediators such as a keyboard or a mouse. The E-windows are based on a software which runs on affordable technologies ( such as Raspberry Pi, a flat monitor, a webcam, Linux ). The OS is Raspbian which is a free operating system, optimized for the Raspberry Pi hardware, that coincides with the open standards as in public, transparent and accessible to everyone . It provides an encrypted and secure connection as we strongly believe in freedom of speech.
It is also optimized to be efficiently used on most hardware from single board computers 
such as the raspberry pi to high end pc’s.  
And it facilitates further experimentation with new hardware of software features.
To build the e-window , you need a monitor , a small computers such raspberry pie 2, 
a webcam and a pair of speakers. 
All the E–window need to operate after  is a Stable video and audio connection  and Small band usage (short bandwidth). 
The appearance is customizable  and could easily be altered and adjusted .

The e-window is a prototype that was developed to facilitate the exchange and the flow of ideas between shared working spaces known as the Multifactory network. The multifactory is  a network of shared workspace across Europe and the e-window is a tool that ensures the   constant circulation of ideas in sharing knowledge and in exchanging skills and professional services between the spaces involved
 “Electronic Window” solves two current problems:  first it let team members working in different buildings, cities or countries to share daily life and common values which is crucial team building. Second it lowers the email communication that in the last years increased so much that it loses power on communication.
This is a way to use an already existing technology that is totally differentThe In what differs compared to a skype call? To make a skype call, you have to ALREADY know who you are calling, you need their contact, and so on. With the electronic window, you can easily interact with people you never met before.


How it can be used in the Future ?
==================================
This Technology offers new ways to work: we can connect each other from everywhere in the world, we can share skills and experience . It is is the solution to real problem faced by many different communities of interest and is an answer to a real need, it can become a new practical and common way of communicating by moving ideas not people. This would result in a faster, better, cheaper way to work.
The e-window can be adapted to local or personal needs in emerging communities in Africa or other developing communities and could be used to form possibly and unconventional partnerships between enterprises, startups , actors of international cooperation ,NGOs, Italian universities and research centers and countries of global south.
The E-window is based on a free Open Source software and accessible to everybody as we strongly believe that a free software communication platform is necessary to protect freedom of speech and e-democracy. and it’s easy and cheap to build it yourself of an estimated cost around 300 euros. It can be replicated anywhere in the world with no hardware problems. We would like to spread it in the South of the World to have direct and non-mediated communication with startups and local entrepreneurs. 

We think this tool can break down physical, political and mnemonic walls……..

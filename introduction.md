## It is like a window in a wall
![the typical CASE di RINGHIERA, in North Italy. Every window is one in front of the other one and interaction is much more than in a flat.](Hackpad-D-export-09Dec2016_files/multifactory.jpg)

## It is a tunnel for comunication, a co-presence system.

## You find it in physical spaces.

## It is open source

-->     WE BELIEVE it is time to do a STEP BACK and RETHINK on how to use technologies for comunication purposes.

#### The E-window is based on a free Open Source software and accessible to everybody as we strongly believe that a free software communication platform is necessary to protect freedom of speech and e-democracy. 
#### And itâ€™s easy and cheap to build it by yourself of an estimated cost around 300 euros. 
#### It can be replicated anywhere in the world with no hardware problems. 
#### We would like to spread it in the South of the World to have direct and non-mediated communication with startups and local entrepreneurs, build partnerships between peers, build a decentralised communication system, non depending on top down policies. 
#### We think this tool can break down physical, political and mnemonic walls.
